LWC-PhysicalShop
================

The LWC-PhysicalShop plugin for Bukkit prevents any of PhysicalShop's
shops from being protected by LWC.

Without this plugin, a player who makes a shop might forget to use LWC
to lock a shop's chest too, and then another player could /cprivate
that chest. Neither player would be able to use the chest as LWC and
PhysicalShop would disagree as to who owns the chest. With this mod,
PhysicalShop alone is in charge of protecting its own shops, and LWC
is in charge of everything else as usual.

Installing
----------

Make sure you have LWC version 4.0 or higher, and PhysicalShop version
9.0 or higher. Place the LWC-PhysicalShop.jar file in the plugins/
directory. You're done.
