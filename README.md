LWC-PhysicalShop
================

The LWC-PhysicalShop plugin for Bukkit prevents any shops from being
protected by LWC. Without this plugin, a player who makes a shop might
forget to use LWC to lock the chest too, and then another player could
/cprivate that chest. Neither player would be able to use the chest as
LWC and PhysicalShop would disagree as to who owns the chest.

Installing
----------

Make sure you have LWC version 4.0 or higher, and PhysicalShop version
9.0 or higher. Place the LWC-PhysicalShop.jar file in the plugins/
directory. You're done.
